  <main>
    <p><strong>MedBridge</strong> is a platform designed to reduce medical waste and improve access to unused medicines and equipment.</p>

    <p>Users can donate or rent items, while NGOs can request large-scale support. A portion of rental fees goes to our Disaster Reserve Fund to support emergency preparedness.</p>

    <p>We're committed to building a stronger, healthier community — together.</p>
